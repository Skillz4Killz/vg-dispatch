## Pre-Queue

Queue times are something that can take anywhere from one minute to over fifty minutes. On average in Ranked, the queue time can range from two-eight minutes of queue before a match is found. This leads to a lot of time wasted, as there is not much a player can actually do while waiting. Majority of the options in game when clicked cause the game to be closed and opens an external link. Anything that the player does intend to start will become deleted. The Pre-Queue system will allow players to be able to queue for a match during their current match. When a player is in a match and is hoping to queue for another match because they want to play another match afterwards now they can. The Pre-Queue system will allow a player to begin searching and matching players behind the fold \(pun intended\). Once the choke point turret has been destroyed, an option will appear in the scoreboard allowing a player to begin searching for the next match. This will begin searching and placing a player into a match.

From public knowledge of the current system, the game matches players until there are six players to be able to play together, taking into account three man team parties specifically against three man team parties. With the pre-queue system the queue would work essentially the same just when it finds a team to play and you are still in a match, it will remove you from that match and add you to queue once again by restarting the queue until another is found and repeating this cycle until the player finishes the match and is finally confirmed for the next match. Pre-Queue system takes into account parties as well, for example when a player clicks Pre-Queue others can also choose to turn Pre-Queue on and have the ability to queue with same teammates or new.

This can allow a dramatically decreased wait time to go from match to match, allowing for a smooth transition between matches. Queue times are expected to dramatically increase with 5v5 launching and other game modes being introduced, causing the eight minute queues to possibly rise to ten minutes or more. 5v5 queue times will logically be much larger as well as it requires more participants to be online to be able to queue. The Pre-Queue system will help against these issues.

## In-Game Browser

Currently, clicking on a link in game forces you to close the Vainglory app and view the link outside in the browser. If a player is in the middle of the queue and wants to read some lore or community articles, the entire Vainglory app needs to be suspended, stopping the queue. Allowing players to be able to interact with the app and the community while they are queueing in game without having to close the app will be tremendous in increasing user satisfaction. Imagine a restaurant where people are asked to wait in line to receive their food. They are not able to do anything while waiting in line except talk to the other people waiting in line with them. Instead there is another restaurant that offers television, newspapers, and small snacks while they wait for their food. User satisfaction will rise tremendously and community involvement will be increased as well if users are allowed to be able to see and do more inside the app while waiting in queue and not forced to close the app. Similar to how Twitter opens a browser in the app when clicking on external links, VG could have the same mini-browser open in game for users to interact and do so much more while they are waiting.

## Hero Lore

The lore of the heroes of vainglory is extremely enjoyable to know, and changes your view of the game in a very positive way. For example, learning the relationships between heroes like Ardan, Celeste, Vox, Catherine, etc, allows a player to understand them much better, and in turn might make you sad if an Ardan in one team was facing a Vox and Celeste in the other, and happy if they were all on the same team. Sadly, the only way to read up on the lore is to go the Vainglory website and search for the lore you want to know. A new tab under individual hero screens \(which currently consists of Overview, Talents, and Skins\) can be added called Lore. This will redirect you to the lore page of the hero in question through the in-game browser, which can be done in-between match queueing, adding yet another fun way to pass time between matches.

## Auto-Vote

Every little bit of improvement on user experience is always helpful. Having the game automatically thumbs up or thumbs down a player would be a great addition. After every game, a player loses a minimum of 5 seconds or even more to vote and give every player a thumbs up. Having everyone already given a thumbs up and allowing the player to only have to decide to click finish or change any votes will be time-saving and help users have a much better experience.

If the system detects that a player has AFK or is abusing pings and his ping cooldown was at 30+ seconds that player should automatically receive a vote of AFK or Rude Pings. If a player is detected to be intentionally losing like selling items or buying 1 item and throwing the game they will be automatically voted.

The auto-vote has two major impacts on user experience. The first and obvious one is the time-saving benefit. The second huge impact is on human psychology. Players will know and be at ease that the system is doing its job in some manner to detect trolling and is punishing them behind the scenes. Currently, there is no form of seeing whether a player is punished and sometimes the notification received about a player you reported has been punished is received days if not weeks after voting so as a user who reports such behavior, it has little to no impact on the belief that it is effective. A player seeing which players are detected by the system and punished in some manner is going to be a lot more impactful on user experience.

## Hero Selection

An area that can drastically improve user experience with only a few minor adjustments is hero selection. The hero selection screen in both blind and draft mode can be fine-tuned to be able to help all players. The current system, while nice and compact, could be a hindrance in the future with the addition of new heroes. Picking a hero could be a bit of a struggle for new players or for those who are unfamiliar with it.

### Custom Order

A small change that can help improve user experience for both beginners and veterans is allowing the hero order to be customizable. Customizing the ordering of all the heroes based on the player’s preference would be extremely helpful. This can help players to hasten the process of going through the list and shorten wasted time. For example, a carry or jungle main does not need to see the list of captain heroes first. A slight adjustment to the hero selection screen can help players have a much better experience and enjoy playing the game that much more since they are not confused by all the heroes especially as the hero pool grows.

_**NEED A DESIGN HERE SHOWING THIS Option to customize**_

### Recommended

Another very useful feature that can be created for both veteran and beginner players is recommended hero selection. There is a recommended shop screen for players to buy items but a player is not recommended which hero to pick. No matter if it is blind pick or draft pick a player can be recommended to pick a hero based on two important factors. The first factor is team synergy. For example, if a team-mate picks up a hero like Fortress it could recommend Koshka as they synergize very well together. The second factor to take into consideration is only applied in draft mode, countering enemy picks. For example, if the enemy picks a Krul a player can be recommended to pick up a Skye, Petal, and various other heroes that can help counter the enemy picks. Recommended heroes should also be moved to the top of the hero list so that players can easily see them.

## Majority-win surrendering

Majority-Vote Surrender causes situations where a player is forced to forfeit a game that he or she wishes to play, and is removed from the match. This becomes a much bigger issue when it occurs in Ranked.

A slight adjustment needs to be made to this features using Bots in order to dramatically improve it and solve all problems. Although bots are not the most intelligent of team mates, they are far better than trolls or AFK players. A player that does not want to play will cause trolling, feeding, rude pings and other forms of toxic behavior. Furthermore, they will provide no benefit to the player and may in fact hurt the team. A toxic player can steal all the CS and then not help in the team fights allowing the enemy team to have a huge advantage as majority of the gold on the team is not being used. Whenever a player surrenders whether it is a 1 player vote or a 2 player vote, these players should be removed from the game and no longer be participating in the match after their second time trying to surrender. This does mean that starting a surrender vote should not automatically grant a players vote to surrender. Once a vote is started if a player votes to surrender they are removed from that match and the appropriate VST & MMR is taken from that player and spread to the enemy team. This player is in turn replaced by a bot. This allows players who don’t wish to give up to continue playing and still have a chance at winning. It also allows players to leave the game when they believe they are no longer able to win and they choose to surrender. Upon loss, the player remaining on the team with a bot will lose the appropriate amount of VST and MMR. If the player and the bots manage to win, the match the team will win the appropriate amount of VST and MMR. This should be split equally to all team members as it is required to have a Zero Sum System as well as maintaining no method to easily boost players by simply throwing to them and having them have bots. Although it is not the best option to give the VST and MMR to quitters, it is required to keep the zero sum system intact and fair.

## Replay

One of the coolest features introduced into Vainglory has been the ability to save replays. However, itis still lacking in various areas.

### Instant Saves

One of the concerns that players have is the ability to instantly save something. Currently, there are two ways to save a replay. Either you have to be recording the match before it started and then only when you finish the match should you edit the recording and click save. The other option is to do so after the match is over and start the replay mode on the game and now go through and edit it. However, when a player is in a party and they want to save the match, they are forced to leave the party because they want to save that replay or force their team to wait for a very long amount of time. We suggest creating a way to instantly save the last minute of gameplay when the button is pressed automatically. Having an option turned on for Instant Saves will allow a player to tap the button and instantly save the awesome replay and get back to taking that kraken or pushing after that insane play. However, to be safe that it capture the entire desired moment it should capture the last sixty seconds. This means that the instant save option is “always recording” but self deletes its past recorded data and only maintaining the sixty second time length upon tapping of the save button. This also will allow a much smaller video for a player to have to go through to be able to edit the awesome replay.

_**NEED A DESIGN HERE SHOWING THIS quick save button**_

### Server Storing

On occasion, when recording a match the recording may cause an issue and entirely delete any and all recorded data because there is no space left on the device. A possible solution can be to alert the user of how much space they have left on their device when they begin recording or to allow a 40 minute match worth of data to be saved in the server. This would allow players to complete the game when the match finishes, continue playing with his or her team and go delete stuff on the device when necessary to be able to go back and download that video after making room. The video would only be stored for a short duration on the server. Although this isn’t a huge concern many players have stopped trying to even record due to these issues of losing all data with no way of retrieving it.

## Instant Re-sell

Players commonly complain about accidentally purchasing an item. Items should be able to be freely sold at the same cost as shopping as long as the shop area. Once leaving the shop area the item will only be able to sold at the normal sale prices. Using an item, attacking, or taking damage will automatically end the grace period.

_**NEED A DESIGN HERE SHOWING THIS Sell at full cost**_

## Improving Karma

Karma is a system that needs a huge overhaul and a detailed suggestion was provided in the first edition of Dispatch. What was not mentioned in the first edition is how to gain or lose Karma and improving this sytem. Currently, the only way to gain or lose karma is by receiving thumbs up or thumbs down. Thumbs up have almost no function except giving a person a slightly higher karma. But when karma does not have nearly any function except a small glory boost which is not an immediate satisfaction, users feel as if karma is broken. Every player that was spoken to believed that "giving thumbs up or down does nothing". Although when asked in detail they were aware that the karma system gave extra glory but to their satisfaction this was meaningless. User satisfaction is mostly derived in a player from an immediate action instead of a prolong after affect.

In order to give users this immediate satisfaction the function of thumbs up and down needed to be adjusted. When player A thumbs up player B or C, that player B or C recieve 5\* glory and player A will lose that amount of Glory. Five glory is a good amount as it is not too much that users will not give thumbs up but it is an amount that users will feel like this thumbs up meant something. That player B helped do an amazing job last match so they deserve a thank you gift. A thumbs up should also grant more karma to a player because of its higher cost to send one. 5\* Glory is also an amount that is small enough that can not be abused.

No! Stop thinking about it! A thumbs down will not take 5\* Glory from the other player and give it to you. ;\)

Giving a thumbs down will cost 25\* glory but this Glory will dissapear but have a much larger impact on the receiving players karma.

_Note: These changes will only apply to teammates and not enemies._

_\*: Glory is based on a Standard Game Mode. Battle Royale, and Blitz will be lowered as they are shorter matches and similarly to any other game modes in the future._
