## Quests

The current flaw with the quest system is that it does not take the players into consideration. While the veterans don’t feel the effects as much, new players do; for example, hero-based quests are given to the player even if the player in question doesn’t own that hero.

While the above problem affects new players, it doesn’t affect veterans nearly as much. The problem veterans face lies within the issue of them not wanting to play other modes; if they only like to play rank, why make them play casual, or if they only like to play brawl modes, why make them play ranked?If a player mains roam why force them to play Ringo?While it is helpful to force new players to try other modes, most of the veterans have already played other modes, why make them do more? Quests should be given on a basis that anyone can achieve them no matter if it is a veteran or a beginner on a per match basis. Quests should never feel like they are forcing a player to try something or that it is limited making players have nothing to strive for once the quest is completed. Quests should be made so that they can be achieved by any hero and in any game mode at any time. The current form of quests should be converted to be called achievements.\*

_\*: Achievements will be explained in depth, in its own section below._

### Match Quests

Quests should not just be quests in general but also quests made per match. Every match a player is assigned three quests to accomplish in that match. For example, a captain can be tasked with getting one assist in the match, using a crucible to block an enemy ability and hero specific quest like “Stun an enemy with Verse of Judgement”. The more quests that a player completes the better the post game rewards are. The difficulty of the quest can be determined by the MMR of the player as described in the first edition of Dispatch. Higher MMR junglers can be asked to achieve gold from enemy jungle camps. Higher difficulty quests should also result in higher rewards.

### Achievements

With quests being changed to a much shorter duration match based quests, long term quests should be considered as achievements and made much harder. For example, instead of a quest that requires destroying 100 turrets it could be a level one achievement. This achievements level two would be by destroying 1,000 turrets and so forth. Achievements will be a lifetime accomplishment and will be much harder to get then current quests which can be accomplished in a matter of hours. Every achievement could start by having a minimum of three attainable levels and as majority of the playerbase obtains these achievements, the levels can be increased by a factor of ten. Achievements should be present in the Goals tab.

The Goals tab would be similar to the social tab which includes friends, guilds and teams. The goals tab will keep track of every accomplishment that a player has earned. For example, keeping track of trophies, achievements, etc…
