## Home Screen User Interface

The home screen can sometimes appear to be cramped with everything in it that does not help a player. The home screen icons should be smart enough to know when they should appear on the home screen and when they should be hidden. The home screen carousel should cover the entire screen and not just a part of it. This would allow players to witness the beauty of the assets that are made for it. For example, a new skin is now able to be seen with all its beauty at the full screen size. The items on top of the screen such as quests should be transparent. Furthermore, when quests are completed and there are no quests to do the quests should become hidden making a much better home page experience. Similar to quests the “games won” indicator should also become hidden once you have had the three daily wins. By having these icons hide and appear when they are available makes it much easier for a player to know whether something is there for them to complete or they have already accomplished it. All accomplished tasks can be seen in the hidden menu.

## Surrender Menu

The surrender menu has been quite obtrusive and can cause frustration to players that are matched with teammates that just want to quit and consistently try to surrender. In order to be less obtrusive, the surrender vote menu should disappear entirely and simply become an announcement, similar to what you see when a turret is destroyed or a player gets a killstreak. An announcement can be made saying “Your Ally Voted To Surrender”. In order to surrender, a player can open the scoreboard and click to vote on the scoreboard itself. This allows a player to continue playing without being forced to have a surrender screen in front of them or be able to surrender when necessary. The announcements is also a good way for a teammate to alert their allies they wish to surrender without causing much harm to the visual experience during any moment of the match like a team fight.

## Wins/Played

This refers to the in-game wins used to represent the number of that a person has won using matchmaker. Currently, this number represents the total number of wins in brawl and standard modes meaning it has gained some value but lost a lot of value. Previously, this number was a good factor for determining a smurf account because it could be used to compare the win rate by checking the number of wins and comparing it with the total number of games played in ranked using the API. The majority of the playerbase on average has an approximate win rate of 50% as the game is designed to make you win and lose 50% of the time. The few exceptional pro players like L3oN don’t follow this pattern, but for the majority this was a good tool for guilds and tournament organizers to check for smurf accounts.

Although having a total wins number is good, each game mode should also show its own unique wins in order to be able to use the number much more efficiently. Currently, the number has lost a lot of its amazing functionality for guilds and tournament organizers since it no longer is displaying an accurate figure based on standard game modes.
