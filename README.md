# Preface

Months of discussion and hard work as a community since the publication of the first edition have culminated into this massive edition of the Dispatch. The first chapter on the shop was “semi-leaked” early this year so you can skip it if you read it or give it another read, it’s still pretty good. :\) Hope to see everyone on the discord server to discuss once you have read it.
