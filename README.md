# Preface

Months of discussion and hard work as a community since the publication of the first edition have culminated into this massive edition of the Dispatch. The first chapter on the shop was “semi-leaked” early this year so you can skip it if you read it or give it another read, it’s still pretty good. :\) Hope to see everyone on the discord server to discuss once you have read it.

> Dispatch is the result of a dream about making Vainglory succeed. It is our job as the community to portray and express our needs and desires in a manner that is professional and mature. We hope to have many more authors and overall community involvement in the next edition of this project, from designers to developers to everyday players. If you are talented at writing or editing- please help us by contacting us. If you are a player who has good ideas but no writing talent, it’s not a problem - please send in your suggestions. If you are not able to help with anything here, please help spread good word about Vainglory to your friends and families – the more the merrier!

Ladies and Gentleman, we want to thank each and every one of you for taking the time to breeze through this short document . Thanks to everyone who was involved in this project, no matter if you were giving suggestions, designing, typing, formatting, proofreading, or just encouraging us to keep going. Oh, and thank you SEMC for making the best mobile MOBA in the world!

THANK YOU!!!
