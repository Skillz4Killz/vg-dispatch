# Vainglory API

Giving Community Developers the chance to show playersthe Vainglory API was a massive step forward in many regards. It helped give statistics to every player that wantedthemboth for community as well as theproscene. Italsoallowed community developers to be able to take part in Vainglory in away which was previously not possible.Every daymoredevelopers join,and new things are built.As the API improves, the community can help improve Vainglory experience for all players. The API has not received enough love even though it can be a huge influence on improving the community with enough love in the right places. Community developers need a few things that can help improve this for them and help make their lives easier to build much more amazing content for everyone.

## Missing Information

Information coming from the API should only be limited in small minute cases. For example, the amount of ICE bought by a player is something that can be considered to be private information but there is very little that can be at a level that deserves to be kept hidden from the API for the developers. Since November, the community and developers have been asking for content being added to the API that received no replies from SEMC. Developers are left waiting for features since November. For example, guild data has been requested since the API announced. In fact, it was one of the first things requested with a whole list of items requested for guilds in specific sent for it. It has been over half a year since API released data and yet still a huge portion of extremely relevant, non-private data is not accessible. This leads to community developers being left without content and their projects being blamed for not having such data and losing potential users forever. Guilds is just one feature that is missing from the API. A list of data that was requested but without any response will be shown below. Having these information can help solve a lot of problems that the community faces and leads to a better user experience all over.

## Updating Bad Information

A lot of information on the API is also considered as “Bad Information”, not because it is in anyway bad but either there is not correct or is mislabeled leading to really bad experience all over. If developers choose to use this data it can lead to the project being considered as incorrect. For example, VST was recently added to the API a couple months ago and it has been brought to almost every project attention from users that it is incorrect. The blame of the incorrect data is implied and sent to the community developers for showing incorrect VST trophies because the data from the API shows the numerical representation of VST as 2,400 but the player in game shows a screenshot that he achieved 2,600. Players have continuously reported incorrect information that really results in bad performance. Other community developers have chosen not to use certain data that is considered as Bad Information on their projects making their projects seem less simply because another project has data that they don’t. This data could be incorrect or it could simply be mislabeled and requires more clarification. For example, perhaps the number that API reports for VST in past seasons is not the highest earned but what it was at when season ended. Perhaps this is MMR. Perhaps this number is something we can not possibly predict.

Another form of bad information is what is considered as different styles of data. For example, some hero abilities are named in certain ways and other abilities are named in completely different formats. This causes a huge concern and an issue for the developers as it causes each community developer to have to maintain a huge database of different types of names and data for each one and have them translated to the user friendly version.

### Clarifications

Some information isn’t considered as bad information but in serious need of clarifications. For example, there are still many pieces of data that community developers are not certain of and have had to experiment and spend a lot of time figuring out what each one is instead of simply just having a conduit of information saying: This refers to this detail in game. One example is seasonal VST but another one is lifetimeGold

lifetimeGold was one of the most confusing topics that arose which it took a very long time to figure out what it was. This appears to be the amount of gold earned in a match instead of in a player’s lifetime. This became a concern amongst many developers about what lifetimeGold really is and discussions began many times at everyone trying to guess what it could be referring to. All of these problems could be solved by having some clarification on each item released into the API explaining what they refer to exactly.

## Advance Warning To Breaking Changes

On occasion the API has had breaking changes that have caused many community projects to crash on almost every update. The changes in the data are so drastic and unexpected that community projects become broken and once again causes bad user experience for the projects causing a loss of users. For example, when a new hero or item is released this data is non-existent in the API until the day of the patch meaning no community developer can prepare for it in advance and when a player uses that new hero the project will break as it receives unexpected data. On other occasions the data is sent in different ways that was unexpected so developers can’t possibly even guess beforehand.

Sometimes the existing data is changed without any warning causing breaks as well. For example, when data went from a format of1000\_Item\_Flarewas changed to Flare.Although these types of changes are incredible, they break nearly every project and with no advance warning, community developers have no way of preparing for it. If a project developers has work on the day of the update or perhaps is located in a time zone where it is 3AM during the update, their project remains broken until the issue is fixed. These issues are serious issues that can be solved by simply relaying the data to the community developers a day in advance. For example, upon release of the patch notes to the public, the data set of any changes whether modification or new data should be relayed to the community developers.
