## Sunlight Rewards

The rewards given by achieving a Sunlight level are lacking to say the least.

Sunlight levels should help to determine the type of chest the daily chest will be. Chest Frequency would also change.

* Levels 1-25: Basic Chest \(Every 6 Hours\)

* Levels 26-50: Silver Chest \(Every 12 Hours\)

* Levels 51-75: Gold Chest \(Every 18 Hours\)

* Levels 76-100: Dragon Chest \(Every 24 Hours\)

Two Chests will still be able to be stored as usual.

Note: Resources given by the daily chest will be significantly less than that of the chest given by leveling up. The chest type is to signify that the rewards would be greater than the prior chest, & the probability of receiving better rewards is increased.![](/assets/Sunlight100.jpg)![](/assets/SunlightChest.jpg)

## Skin Disincentivization

Currently players are forced to pick between either their highest rarity skin to

gain the most sunlight, or play their favorite skin at the cost of a good chunk of sunlight. The sunlight system for skins is thus flawed. To change this, we propose that the amount of sunlight a player gains is based upon the highest skin the player owns for that Hero, rather than the skin they have equipped for that match.
