## Improving Communication

Almost all toxicity in the game comes down to one fundamental flaw in any multiplayer game. It is the lack of efficient in-game communication that causes almost all toxicity in every player. One of the biggest drawbacks in Vainglory is the inability to communicate with your team the way you want. The addition of new pings was a welcome change, but there is more that can be done.

### Inefficiency of Pings

The pings and pre-determined text pings will never be enough for a MOBA like Vainglory that requires in the moment decision making and communication. For example, imagine a roamer with good map awareness notices that the enemy has teleported home and pings his team to take Kraken. However, they begin pinging to stop because they are not aware that the enemy has retreated. Eventually, they may start it but by then the damage is not enough to capture Kraken, allowing the enemy to reach there, Ace the team and take the Kraken. Now the roamer will be get pinged continuously for making the right decision and the entire time the other teammates will have no understanding of this leading to further toxicity in this game. However, it was the roamer who made the right decision but was unable to communicate effectively. There are way too many examples of these scenarios which just can not ever be solved with pings. Although pings are useful and required, so is voice communication.

### Voice Communication

Voice communication would allow players to be able to communicate for any situation in any game. The fact is that voice is required for a proper gameplay environment and pings are not enough is evidenced by the fact that SEMC allows voice communication in esports. If they used pings and there was a lack of voice communication in esports we would see a huge decrease in synergy and much more toxicity as well. In solo-queue, the toxicity and lack of proper gameplay is due to a lack of communication and coordination which voice chat provides.

To fix these issues in the game it requires the addition of voice communication. Players should have the ability to mute players’ voices the same way pings can be muted. If for some reason, a player does not wish to hear another player’s voice, they can turn it off. It should also be set to a default setting of ‘off’, and voice comms are only turned on by the player in settings, then the match can have a button similar to the in game streaming to turn their voice off or on. For example, a player can press the mic and say, “Vox, push the enemy turret, we will take the miner”, and turn voice off if they wish, like a push to talk button. Or the player can simply keep voice on at all times if so desired.

One inconsistency with voice communication is a language barrier. However, a language barrier is no different than a barrier formed by one player understanding proper usage of a ping and others not understanding it. It is also not a reason for being against in-game voice communication. For those that wish to use voice, they should have the option of using voice, while those who are not interested have no compulsion to do so. Since not all players would be using voice communication, players should have an icon next to their name in hero selection/in the match, that shows that they are using voice chat.

Of course, voice communication will also bring new toxicity along with it, which cannot be helped, hence there should be a new option to thumbs down after the end of the match, for ‘toxic use of voice chat’. This should have a higher penalty than a normal thumbs down, to minimize offensive behaviour, as hearing others insult you rather than just getting pinged or seeing it typed out can be very hurtful.
