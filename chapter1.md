# Recommended Items \(Released Early In Jan\)

One idea that was heard many times was to improve the shop screen. Instead of just one recommended item, you have two separate rows: Recommended and Suggested.![](http://vgdispatch.weebly.com/uploads/1/0/0/6/100609648/redo-2_orig.jpg)           

                                                     Figure 1: New recommended tab in shop.

## Custom Builds

## ![](http://vgdispatch.weebly.com/uploads/1/0/0/6/100609648/imageskillzbuilds_orig.jpg)           

                                                                      Figure 2: Academy Tab

In addition to seeing the build recommendations by SEMC, players are able to make their own. These builds are located in the Academy tab. During Hero selection, players can select their custom build just like selecting a skin.The selected build then appears in the Recommended tab of the shop screen. It shows the current path as designated by the chosen build; if that build recommends buying a fountain, it will show the path to a fountain. As you buy items in that set, they should become greyed out with a small green check mark, in order to distinguish an item bought and an item for which you lack the gold to buy. However, if a player buys a Dragonheart instead of a Lifespring, it should remove the checkmark from the Oakheart portion of the path to the Fountain, in order to allow them to build that Fountain. If the recommended build has two Hourglasses and a player buys the Hourglass out of the path’s order, it would automatically darken and place a checkmark where it appears. However, if they sell this item or build something outside of the recommended path like a Contraption instead of Stormcrown, the Stormcrown set would reset. Each recommended build comes in sets depending on which item Tier you wish to recommend. A player should be able to recommend one Tier 1,2, or 3 item at a time, with the corresponding build path being loaded automatically.  

You can recommend a player to build a Sorrowblade, or you can simply recommend the player to build a Reflex Block and then go back to their normal build. New players specifically would benefit greatly from the ability to try out various builds.

## Porting Builds

Community tools such as VaingloryFire teach players amazing builds; it would be great to be able to import a build straight from a web site. Perhaps the site can open the VG app url and pass in a URL that, when called, returns the build in a specific JSON format. As shown in figure 2, players can import multiple builds per hero.  This feature has been achieved in many other games, such as Shadow Verse.

## Suggesting Build to Teammate

Players can suggest an item to their teammate, from the score screen.![](http://vgdispatch.weebly.com/uploads/1/0/0/6/100609648/skillzsuggest_orig.jpg) 

                                                                  Figure 3: Suggested Items

In Figure 1, you can see items suggested by your teammates in the Recommended tab. Currently, there is no way to recommend an item to your teammates while in a match. In order to suggest something, a player taps a teammate’s hero in the scoreboard as seen in figure 3. When a suggestion is made, the in-game announcer says “Your ally suggested building an item”. A notification badge would appear on the shop button in the bottom right corner, as seen in Figure 4. Another notification should be displayed next to the recommended tab as seen in Figure 1. If the suggested item is not bought for more than one minute, the suggestion disappears.

                                                       ![](http://vgdispatch.weebly.com/uploads/1/0/0/6/100609648/screen-shot-2017-02-18-at-7-04-22-pm_orig.png)

                                                         Figure 4: Shop notification badges

These slots would normally be left empty, only activating when a teammate sends a suggestion of what to build. Additionally, the recommended item would display who sent said recommendation. When a player is not building defense, you can easily suggest what to buy in their shop screen. This will considerably reduce toxicity. Figure 3 depicts how players can send suggestions through the scoreboard screen by simply holding on the player’s hero and then selecting an item.

## Adapting In Game

![](http://vgdispatch.weebly.com/uploads/1/0/0/6/100609648/redo-2-skip_orig.jpg) 

                                                                             Figure 5: Skip

A major issue with the current system is the fact that there is no way to skip an item that may not be needed \(e.g. If opponents are building double crystal, armor should be able to be skipped\).

Figure 5 introduces the Skip. By simply tapping and holding an item, you have the option to skip it in the recommended paths. Skipping an item will also automatically skip the entire path. For example, you can not keep the Fountain set if you skip the Lifespring.

If the current path shows Tornado Trigger and then Tyrant’s Monocle and you already bought the Lucky Strike, by skipping the Tornado Trigger, you would essentially cause the build to read as if it has been bought entirely and now the Lucky Strike is counted towards the Monocle. If there is an item like Reflex Block and this is skipped, it does not delete the Aegis path but will add the Reflex Block back when it reaches the point where Aegis is required in the path.

                                                                       Figure 6: Slide

What if a player needed to buy an item out of the recommended order? What if a player is on a smaller device, and can’t see all 3 builds together? This is where sliding becomes necessary. Figure 6 displays the ability to slide left and right to see the entire path. On a smaller device the screen should also be able to be scroll down and up in order to allow players to see all the paths.

The shop screen has been in need of some changes, and these changes can help beginner, intermediate, and professional level players. Whether you want to change builds on the fly or learn a proper build from a friend, or even teach others during the match, these suggestions would allow you to do so.
