## Friend Requests

### Accepting/Rejecting

On occasion, it is difficult to know whether a friend request was accepted or rejected. After a match you may receive a friend request but not know for certain who it is. A friend request should have the ability to show a slightly more detailed profile of the player to know whether to accept or reject a player. Receiving friend requests should cause a sound effect similar to when you accept a match.

Another issue that arises with accepting friend requests is that when you accept a friend request, the request disappears and you must now go searching the endless list of friends to find the player. Creating a new field in the friends list that currently goes “Requests &gt; Team &gt; Guild &gt; Friends Online &gt; Offline”, and add in a section called ‘New’ after Requests. This will allow a person to find a new friend easily in order to contact them once they are accepted. This issue becomes much larger if both players friend one another after the match and the players have no idea whether they were accepted or not. The new friends list would be a temporary list that only appears when there is a new friend accepted. Once their name is tapped on, tapping away from it will remove this player from the new friends list. This extra tab would not be shown when you have no new friends, to minimize use of space. Additionally, you would get a notification similar to when you get invited to a guild/team when somebody accepts your friend request. This solves the issue of repeatedly refreshing your friends list to see if someone accepted your request.

### Auto-Accepting Requests

Some players just love to have all the friends in the world. However, accepting every request can get tedious. Creating a setting that allows a user to turn on Auto-Accept Requests will cause any request sent to that player to be automatically accepted. These players would be added to the New Friend list with a small symbol showing they were accepted automatically. The symbol would be removed at the same time when the player is removed from the ‘New Friends’ tab.![](/assets/newsection copy copy.jpg)

### Pending Requests

Many players have an issue with receiving friend requests and having 99+ friend requests at all times. Allowing players to friend request players without a way for players to have an option to turn off friend requests is something that can be improved. Imagine a pro player having 99+ friend requests who wants to add someone who he played an enjoyable match with, he can not go through that list because he may very well have 1000 names there but instead he has to manually add the player. An option for a player to turn on where it ignores or blocks friend requests from another player once they have been rejected would solve this problem.

If the friend request is slided to the right the request is sent into a hidden menu called Pending, which can be opened by going into details by clicking the icon at the top of the Friend Request List. This would help clear up the huge amount of friend requests certain players receive.![](/assets/pendingreq.jpg)

### Filter

Players that have a lot of friends sometimes need to have some way to sort and filter them much easier. Currently the friends list is filtered through a couple different factors, which only differentiate between various in-game communities like teams and guilds. Adding some additional factors to allow improved filtering would be much more user friendly. Imagine a player wanting to filter their friends list to show Highest VST to Lowest VST because they are looking for people to rank with. These filters could be immensely more powerful with built in profiles where users could select their main roles and heroes so that you could filter them by saying, for example, that you are looking for junglers which would allow you to view junglers at the top. Filters are the key to improving user experience when it comes to large lists of anything, especially friends in game.![](/assets/filterfriend.jpg)
