## Improving Current Game Modes

### Ranked

Currently, there is no incentive for any player to play ranked mode except to have trophies. These trophies can help serve for purposes like joining guilds, teams, and just bragging rights. However, ranking should be a much more critical part of the game and since the introduction of brawl modes, it has become a lot less desired. The amount of players ranking will further decrease as majority of them will instead prefer doing 5v5 and the 3v3 ranked mode will die leaving the only purpose of trophies to be for bragging rights.

A player should be rewarded based on their VST every season. Leaderboards should be created to show the top players in every region per VST. Each level of VST should be rewarded as per their skill tier.

## Draft Mode

Currently, players are thrown into draft mode without knowing the ins and outs of it at around skill tier 6-7\*. There isn't any way that a player would be able to learn how and what to draft or be able to used to this format.

To fix this problem of players not knowing what to draft and how to draft, it is important to add in a recommended hero to pick or ban similar to how items are recommended. Players slowly learn to adjust and realize which hero is good to pick to counter certain drafts and which heroes are good to synergize with with their teammate. To go another step further, small tips are displayed when other players are picking saying things such as, your teammate has banned Ringo, this is a good choice because your teammate has an extremely low win rate when playing against a Ringo. Seeing this information will allow teammates to realize that the person is not trolling and banning a hero that wasn’t voted for but there was a valid reason.

\*: Please note that this and all future cases where skill tiers are discussed in regards to draft mode, assume it refers to an MMR equivalent of said skill tiers and not VST.

### Draft for All

Every player should have access to some sort of draft mode when ranking. Draft mode is important because it requires getting players accustomed to draft from the beginning. By holding players away from draft and suddenly forcing it on them at around tiers 6-7 they are now having problems not understanding it just as beginners will have issues at tier 1. Draft mode should come in increments of difficulty as players rise through the ranks of visual skill tier.

* Just Beginning - Worthy Foe:Draft with no bans and players are able to pick heroes that enemies have picked.

* Got Swagger - Credible Threat:Draft with no bans but players are not able to pick the same heroes if the enemy has picked it.

* Hotness - Simply Amazing:Single Ban Draft

* Pinnacle of Awesome - Vainglorious:Double ban draft

Draft Hero Selection:

One of the major changes that can be made to draft mode is a revamp of the current hero upvote/downvote process. It is absolutely necessary to know which of your teammates upvoted which hero. For example, you are selecting a hero for your captain in SoloQ, and see Phinn upvoted, and select him, but it then turns out that it was the third player who upvoted Phinn, and your captain has absolutely no experience with Phinn, making that match frustrating for him, and likely leading to your loss. Thus, a simple extra feature can be added where every upvote or downvote has a name attached to it, so you know who did it.

Another issue that can be extremely frustrating is if your teammate is selecting a hero, and you have the next selection, if you upvote or downvote a hero for your teammate right after they pick a hero, you end up locking in that hero for yourself. In this situation, you can end up with two roamers or two carries, something that is absolutely detrimental to ranked play. To fix this issue, the hero “lock in” button should be separate to the hero select screen \(similar to how you lock in heroes in blind mode\), or a 3 second delay before you can lock in heroes when your turn arrives.

Another improvement that could be done is to only show the heroes that the current player owns. For example, if it is player two's turn to pick then any hero this player does not own should be hidden. This way every player can clearly see what heroes this players owns and does not own. A lot of toxicity arises from players picking a hero that wasn’t thumbs up and the simple reason they didn’t pick it is because they don’t own that hero at this time. If the players were able to see that a player does or does not own heroes they could make much better strategical advice to their teammates and avoid a lot of toxicity.

Another seemingly small thing that can have a large effect, is when you have the last selection in your team, and you downvote a certain hero your during your first allies turn. He sees the downvote, and does not take him. But, now that hero is prominently displayed next to your name. If the second member of your team did not notice the downvote, he now sees the hero next to your name, and assumes that is the hero you want, and selects it for you. This is another situation where you end up with unwanted team compositions because of a misunderstanding. To fix this is extremely simple, just remove the picture of the hero you upvoted/downvoted that appears next to your name immediately after that round of selection ends. Thus, the box next to your name will be blank after your upvote/downvote is no longer needed.

In the complexity of draft mode, just upvoting and downvoting heroes is not sufficient to properly convey what you mean. Swapping heroes is a huge part of the strategy behind draft mode. If you upvote a hero, even if you have your role marked, your allies cannot be sure if you've upvoted it for them to take, or for yourself, so you can swap later. Thus, a “Hero Swap” button can be added next to the upvote and downvote buttons. The hero you use the “Hero Swap” button on will be displayed next to your name in the given box, with a prominent ‘swap’ icon next to it, making it clear that is the hero you want for yourself. Once this is added, it will greatly reduce miscommunication issues that draft mode is currently rife with.

### Battle Royale

One of the biggest things lacking in Battle Royale is the Battle Royale Score. Blitz now has a numerical representation of its VST, so why does Battle Royale not have its own score as well? Giving Battle Royale its own VST would be a really cool addition, and this would also help a lot of players that truly enjoy Battle Royale to be able to have a nice representation of their skill.

Another thing lacking in brawl modes is trophies. With Ranked, you have trophies that are saved and the player can see whenever they want, but for majority of the playerbase that plays brawl modes, there is no form of trophies or achievements that a person can collect.

### Blitz

Blitz has become the most played game mode very quickly. Based on the data from the API, Blitz is played a lot more as compared to other game modes.

#### Hero Statistics

Blitz game mode has an entirely separate balancing system where every heroes and items statistics can be different. Currently, there is no way for a player to read this information except in the patch notes. Creating a new tab for Blitz statistics that can easily be switched in game would help a lot of players. Also allowing players to pick a default setting so that players could have Blitz shown first as opposed to standard.

#### Talents At Hero Selection

When selecting a hero in game for a blitz match, there is no way to read about the heroes talents. Currently, a player can read the abilities descriptions and tips of how to use them but it is not possible to read about talents. Furthermore, a cool user experience improvement would be to allow a quick buy/upgrade option of talents once the hero is selected.![](/assets/IMG_6920.jpg)

#### 5 Hero Daily Chest

It would be an huge user experience improvement for every player to be able to have the ability to see which heroes have already been used for this chest.

The chest gives the same reward no matter if you won or lost with a hero. The rewards should be based on victory where if you win with a hero you get a higher reward for that specific hero as opposed to losing with that hero. Losing with a hero can maintain the same amount of rewards as it is currently, and winning can be a bit higher in order to satisfy every player.

#### Swapping Talents

Draft mode allows players to be able to swap heroes with their teammates so why doesn’t blitz? Having the ability to swap heroes or talents with other teammates would be a huge improvement to blitz in many ways. It increases the chance of people having fun and better communication with their teammates as well as a whole new layer of strategy.

#### Free Talent Rotation

Currently, every week there is a free hero rotation allowing players to try a hero for free in order to decide if it is worth buying the Hero. Talents are also something that is bought with the same hard earned currency which should have a free rotation. There are three times as many talents as their are heroes meaning it would be a lot harder to test the free talent rotation. In order to solve this, it is important to have the talent rotation be done on a daily basis where talents change every twenty-four hours. Talents also have many levels as opposed to heroes. If a player has a talent at level x\* and the free talent rotation is that talent the player is able to use the talent at level x + 1\*.

\*Note: The talent level a player is able to use increases by 1 for the twenty-four hour period.

## New Game Modes

### Reflex Rumble \(Type : Practice\)

One of the most important things in Vainglory is mechanical skill, and yet there is a very limited way of practicing and improving a player's mechanics. There is a game mode called Gold Rush which helps a player learn to last hit and improve at farming but what about the activatable item mechanics?

Reflex Rumble is a game mode designed to help improve a player's ability to reflex block anything. When the game mode starts, the player will have 6 Reflex Blocks that can be used independently of one another. This means that the use of one Reflex block will not put the other 5 on Cooldown \(Regular Cooldowns still apply\).

To start the game, the player will pick a hero, and choose how many opponents they wish to have \(Between 3-5\). A player may also choose to have teammates \(These Teammates would be AI controlled\). If they possess teammates, then 3 of their Reflex Blocks will be converted to Crucibles.

Another option the player would have is to either choose what heroes the AI will play, or let the opponents be picked randomly. Allowing it to be random will help a player to learn how to reflex heroes they might not expect normally, whereas picking the heroes will allow the player to hone their skills against a specific set of heroes they may be having trouble with. For example, if a player needs to practice reflex blocking a Phinn Forced Accord, they can pick 3 Phinn bot opponents who will continuously come and use their Ultimate with a 6 second cooldown and a random 1-3 second pause allowing them to practice crucibles and reflex blocks.

This game mode should help players practice against almost every hero ability that has a Crowd Control effect. All cooldowns will be significantly reduced in order to help improve this function. Furthermore, the bots would be standing in different positions and situations. For example, one of the bots may be standing inside a bush like an enemy Phinn would, and you must practice blocking it without vision. In order to complete the game, you must either successfully block a certain amount of abilities, or leave after you are satisfied. This is the player’s choice.

Reflex Rumble would also allow the option to select an item to practice reflex blocking against such as Nullwave Gauntlet or Atlas Pauldron. The enemy bots would consistently try to use these items on the players and thereby allowing them to practice blocking against these aforementioned item abilities as much as possible.  
This game mode would be very helpful, and players would learn to develop their mechanical skill by having this become a daily quest where players must block certain hero abilities every day.

### One For All \(Type: Brawl\)

This game mode allows for a new type of gameplay never before seen in Vainglory. It is designed to allow one hero to be played by every player. For example, all players can go SAW and just Shank for days. \(Pause for imagination =&gt; laughter\). However, the truly beautiful thing about this game mode is how the smallest of intricacies would interact with each other. Can Vox use the Resonance of another Vox on his team? Can Adagio use the Burn from the another Gift of Fire and have a triple chain ultimate of three Adagios? Can three Kestrels manage to snipe the entire team each with an echo making 6 one shot one kills. Can a Kestrel use another Kestrel mist to stun? Learning and discovering how hero abilities will interact with the same hero on the same team will be awesome to see and play with for every player. Eighteen Fortress Wolves!! Can Ozo bounce off another Ozo in the middle of his Acrobounce? Only one way to find out! This would require almost no in game balancing as the entire purpose of this game is to justSHANKhave fun all day long.

This game mode could be made for 3v3 and 5v5. At the start of Hero select, each player would nominate one Hero they wish to have be the team's sole Hero. Then once the sixty second timer is up, a single Hero from the 3-5 chosen Heroes will be chosen at random as the team’s sole hero.

Note: Not nominating a Hero is akin to that of dodging.
