## Removing Unnecessary Currencies

Currencies are getting out of hand to a point that there is almost a currency for every region. Vainglory should only have three currencies and nothing more. The first currency is ICE which is bought and can be used to buy anything and everything in the game outside of the matches. The second currency is Glory which is able to be earned by playing the game. Glory can also buy anything and everything in a game outside the matches. The third and final currency is gold which is earned in a match and is used to buy items during a match. For players that currently have Essence and Opals they should be converted into Glory and any items that have a cost of Essence or Opal should be converted into the equivalent cost of Glory. Calculations to convert Essence and Opals into Glory and ICE are shown below. This also means removing unwanted Essence and Opals from chests allowing players to once again receive better rewards.
