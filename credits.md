# Joining The Dispatch

The Dispatch team is always looking for more writers, editors, graphic designers and players to serve as the think tank to provide ideas and suggestions. We hope to invite everyone in the community that would be interested in taking part of Dispatch to make future editions even more amazing.

We also would love to have any and all “EVIL Doers” join us in our private channel as well so we can discuss with them and be able to work together at making this an amazing game and community.
