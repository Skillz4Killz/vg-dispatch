# Guilds

Guilds are one of the core features of Vainglory that truly makes players want to continue playing. It’s a feature that allows players to build a connection with others on a level that simply would not exist if guilds had never been implemented. However, guilds right now just do not have the proper tools to help build the best possible communities. With the proper tools, guilds can help fix many issues prevalent in the Vainglory community today. In properly maintained guilds, problems such as toxicity, insta-locking, rage-pinging, cyberbullying and many more can be fixed. Not only do guilds help to solve issues, but they also help players grow by allowing them to learn from those they forge a relationship with. Guilds are a great feature that can help empower the community and thus improve it, but without the proper tools, this can never be truly accomplished.

Note: This is not a complete list of features needed to the guilds system but an addition to the list created in the first edition of Dispatch.

## Prime Times

The current concept of prime time is flawed by design. The one hour “prime time” indicator does not accurately show when a guild is active. Even if prime time is set to a one hour or even a five hour range, the fact is that it only shows one set time period.

If a player comes online at 10 PM but the prime time says 7 PM, this is going to make it appear as if the guild is not active for the player as they start at 10 PM, when in reality there could be 30+ people playing at 10 PM. Even if it was made so that the range of prime time was from 4-9 PM, the confusion would still exist. The confusion caused by this design is akin to the same confusion for VST when it reset. Players do not feel they can be in a guild whose prime time doesn’t match with their timings.

Prime time itself should be removed, as it causes misunderstandings and is ultimately unnecessary.

Instead of prime time being a filter in the guild search, create a number of active players at certain timeslots as a filter. When a player needs to find a Guild, they can enter a number of players and a time slot \(such as 1pm, 5am, 10pm, etc\), and then the guilds that meet the requirement of the set amount of players on average playing at the inputted time slot are displayed. For example, if a player searches with a filter of 10 PM and five players this will show a list of guilds that have a minimum of five players at 10 PM. Using the Vainglory API it can easily be determined the usual playing times of guild members and this field can be made to be automated so that guild leaders do not have to input any such number.

## Alliance/Rival System

With fame comes both friends and foes, so why don’t we have an alliance system? In this system, a guild leader could select up to 5 guilds that they wish to have on their ally list.

This could have many uses behind the scenes and allow for many future applications. For example, when a player needs a break from grinding fame due to personal reasons, they can simply be transferred to an allied guild and not lose their veteran status and Fame count for when they are ready to return.

It can be used to once again bring together the broken communities of sister guilds under one banner. Furthermore, the option to view the members of allied guilds would appear, just as you see your own guild members in one list at the top, in its own tab.

## Swapping Members

In order to transfer a guild member to another allied guild without any damage to guild status and seasonal fame, it must require a player swap. This means that a player can not be sent to an allied guild without another player from the allied guild being swapped with said player. If a player is in an allied guild as a result of a swap, and then is kicked from the allied guild; the player swap is cancelled resulting in the player returning to the original guild.

_**NEED A DESIGN HERE SHOWING THIS PLAYER SWAPPING**_

## Teamwork

To help incentivize teamwork amongst allied guilds, there should be a reward for playing with other allies. So when allied guilds play with each other, and/or are allies in a party and playing together, they should both receive some reward, such as 75% fame per allied guild member per match as opposed to the 100% you would gain from playing with your own guild member. For example, if playing with a guild member you get 100 fame, then playing with an ally will net 75 fame.![](/assets/Fame XP.jpg)

### Guild Types

The current guild types are casual, competitive, semi-competitive and, school. They serve almost no function except being used as a search filter but it isare almost impossible to define what you fall under. Each of these terms are subjective and a competitive guild to some may be about trying to make a single team to compete in Vainglory 8 as opposed to other guilds who may consider it to be one ofunderstand it as being the best grind guilds. Furthermore, certain guilds can fall under multiple categories.

Changing these to have a better impact and understanding on guilds is crucial to fixing the guild system.

* Casual: A guild type that will not allow the guild to have or be a rival to another guild. This guild will serve as a home to guilds that do not want to compete against other guilds.

* Competitive: A guild type that will serve to have rivals\* and become rivals against others as well as well in order to compete on a daily basis. This is the only guild type that should be shown on guild leaderboards. Leaderboards are competitive in nature and must therefore reflect only competitive guilds. Guild Rewards/Trophies\* as explained below will only be available to competitive guilds.

* Semi-Competitive: a guild type that will serve to have rivals and become rivals against others in this guild type BUT semi-competitive guilds to not have the bonus of Spoils of War. They simply get the bragging rights of victory.

* School: Remove this guild type. If “School” represents a guild for players to learn and grow then every guild should serve as a place to teach others. If it represents players that are in “school” like high school or college and can’t be active then it uses “Casual” guild type.

_\*: Explained below in Spoils of War section._

### Spoils of War

Rivals are automatically added and removed based on the level of a guild, the type of guild and allies. A rival must be within a 10 guild level range if under level 70. Once the guilds are level 70, every guild that is level 70 and up are given a 30 level range of rivals as it is very hard to climb the levels for majority of guilds at that point.

When a guild faces a rival in Matchmaker, it should be Winner-Take-All. So when a guild beats their rivals, they get double fame and double glory. The losing guild do not gain any fame nor glory for that match. It creates a real competition for guilds to be the best and come out as victors.

![](/assets/IMG_0182.jpg)![](/assets/IMG_0182%282%29.jpg)

#### Matchmaker

Since players gain a bonus for when they face a rival guild in matchmaker and/or play with an ally guild, the priority for facing rivals and/or being placed with allies should be increased for all competitive guild types. This means that players should be more likely to be matched up against rivals and paired up with allies than they normally would be able to. Of course, this doesnotapply to ranked matches.

### Leaderboards

The guild leaderboards, currently placed in the top guilds tab, . does not fully show which guilds are really the top nor their rankings amongst other top guilds. This can be fixed by setting up a guild leaderboard where every guild is given four Ranks \(Seasonal & Total Collective Fame\) split up across two locations \(Regional & Global\).

Leaderboards, rewards/trophies\* are provided based on guild fame and not guild levels. Guild levels have an arbitrary limit and once a guild hits that level they no longer have anything to work together as a guild. Instead, changing this to represent total fame in a guild will allow guilds to have something to strive throughout the entire season.

Ranks are the placement on the Leaderboard based on Fame.

* Category: Regional \(NA, EU, SEA, SA, EA, CN\)

* * Regional guild rankings are based solely against guilds in the same Region.
* Category: Global \(All of Earth\)

* * Global guild rankings are against every other guild in the world.
* Rank: Seasonal Fame

* * Based upon how much fame a Guild has collected throughout the season.
* Rank: Collective Fame

* * Based upon the sum total of every guild member’s fame count.

### Guild Trophies/Rewards

In order to promote guilds, there should be rewards for the guilds who place within

the top 100 of their region. These top 100 guilds should also receive trophies to show off their guild’s strength. Regional rewards are given out to the top guilds per region as shown below. A guild that earns the larger global rewards will not receive the regional rewards. The global rewards will be double the amount of the regional reward. All rewards whether regional or global would be done at the end of the season. This will bring back the feeling of loyalty and giving guild members a desire to compete throughout the entire season to achieve a reward. By having rewards given at every five levels, guild members feel it isn’t worth the effort to try to reach the next five levels since they already got their reward and cause a higher guild turnover. Collective Fame rewards would be given out annually. Rewards are given to members based on the amount of effort given by each member. For example, if a guild member did 50% of the guild fame to get them to the top of the leaderboards. 50% of the rewards will be given to this player. This way if a player joins at the end of the season, they will only get rewards based on their effort which will reward guild loyalty helping improve the entire guild system. This reward system will not replace the current chest system, but will be an addition to it.

### Chats

Although there is already a guild chat, in order to fully integrate an alliance system, there will need to be a chat for the entire alliance. Guilds would still have their own chatroom for Intra-Guild discussions In-Guild stuff. There also needs to be a way for guild leaders and officers to be able to moderate the chats, both guild and alliance. Currently, there is no form of moderation for the guild chatroom, which leads to many guilds having to ask their members to not use the chat.

_**NEED A DESIGN HERE SHOWING THIS Moderating Features And Alliance Chat**_

### Loyalty

One of the biggest things that is lacking in guilds is the ability to reward loyalty. There is no way to know how loyal a person is without the ability to know when a person joined.

By having a join date shown, we could create a set of loyalty badges that can be given to the most loyal members.

The badge would be based on the length of time that player has spent in that guild.

The longer a player stays in a specific guild, the higher the rank of their “Loyalty Badge” would become.

* Every seven days \(168 hours\) a player stays in the same guild, their loyalty badge will gain 1 Level, up to a maximum of 50

* * Badges start off at level 0, and each level is raised by winning twenty-one games a week or completing thirty-five games a week without surrendering.

  * * Does not require guild parties

    * Can be with any game mode that uses matchmaker\(PVP\)

Each level in a badge increases the chance of better rewards from the guild chest, and the

leaderboard by 2%, up to a maximum bonus of 100%. If a member is removed for whatever reason their badge levels begins to decay every 48 hours. This means if the removal was by accident or the decision is cancelled, the player has 48 hours to reach out to the guild leaders and be re-invited back. If they are unable to rejoin, the badge level will continue to decay until hitting 0. If they join another guild during this time the level will automatically hit 0. Losing seasonal fame from being removed from a guild has been a concern for many players. Using the loyalty badges, this issue can also be solved. For example, if a player has a badge of any level, their fame will not be reduced to 0 and they will retain their guild membership \(initiate, member, veteran\) until the level hits 0. Once the loyalty badge level is 0, everything from that guild has reset. Switching guilds within an alliance will not cause a decay of loyalty but the loyalty badge levels will not be increasing during the time spent in an allied guild.

_**NEED A DESIGN HERE SHOWING THIS Badges, Join Date, Decay**_

## Raising The Bar

One of the biggest hurdles in the guild system is the fifty guild member limit. Raising this limit can actually solve a majority of guild issues such as sister guilds splintering, a lack of community within guilds, as well as without, and the fact that guilds have to break themselves up just to have more than fifty members.

Often, people will suggest raising the number to something arbitrary such as 100, 150, 200, 1000, etc, but at the end of the day balancing is not done for these numbers and in the future it will just end up having the same problem once again. The guild payouts are balanced for the fifty member limit in a seasonal timeframe. Therefore, any change in the guild member limit must allow the payouts to remain balanced, equivalent to the amount of effort put in.

According to the calculations, it requires \*2,500,000 total fame to hit level 100. \*2,500,000/50 would make 50,000 fame required per member in a seasonal period. 50,000/100 means approximately \*\*500fame is required per member for each level.

For every member after the 50th that joins in a season, 50,000 fame is added to the total fame required to reach level 100. This additional amount of 50,000\*\* fame would be spread out amongst the remaining levels, as evenly divided as possible. For example, if they joined when the guild is level 25, then it adds 500\*\* fame \(This number would be rounded to the highest whole number\) to every remaining level, but level 26 will require an additional 12,000\*\* Fame in order to make up for the levels the player joined after.

Once a player joins, the increased amount of fame required cannot decrease. If they join at the beginning, middle or end of the season, the amount of effort to be put in is the same. At the end of the season the max capacity of guild members gets reduced depending on the number of players that left. The choice to invite a new member which can help grind fame faster comes with a price if this choice is made badly. This responsibility is on the guild leaders to decide when and who to invite to their guilds.

At the end of a season empty spaces over fifty are removed from that guild. For example, a guild has invited a ton of players throughout the season and has had a maximum of 123 spaces but twenty-two players left at the end of the season. Now when the season resets this guild number would be reset to the amount of people left in the guild thereby only requiring the amount of fame equal to number of players left. In this case, the guild amount at the end of the season would be 101 and for the next season the fame calculations will be adjusted for 101 members. If there are less than fifty the guild limit stays at fifty. It will never go below fifty, therefore keeping the fame, all calculations, and balancing intact and favorable to anyone, even the people who have smaller guilds, and those that want to grow cannot abuse the system either, as they require the same amount of work as if they were another guild.

\*If this number is incorrect, the numbers are simply adjusted and the formulas are maintained no matter what the number is.

\*\*This number will be different because fame has a growth curve and the amount changes based on what level the guild is, but this concept can still easily apply.

_**NEED A DESIGN HERE SHOWING THIS Unlimited amount and changes in required fame**_

## Re-Calculating Fame Amounts

Seeing as how guild rewards are one of the best ways to grind enough glory to unlock all heroes, skins and now even talents, it has made players want to get higher guild levels by grinding. No matter how hard it was, players always felt that this goal of one day being able to unlock them all would be possible. The current amount of fame required to reach level 100 after the season two change has altered this feeling from being that of a legendary task to achieve, to feeling more like a repetitive and boring full time job.

Achieving the \*2,500,000 fame to reach level 100 is an impossible goal even for the most grind heavy guilds all over the world. \*2,500,000 fame means a minimum of 50,000 fame per member in a season. Generally, seasons last 12 weeks, but on occasions they have sometimes lasted shorter or longer with no warning or recompense to guilds.

Assuming a season is 12 weeks, this means that guild members require a minimum of 4,167 fame per week or 596 fame per day. 600 fame would average out to about 6 games \(Assuming you win all 6 in a row which is not really possible, even for pro players except if you are L3oN or druid\). This means a minimum of 2 hours a day if you assume the average game time is about 20 minutes. However, the time drastically rises when it includes looking for a party, draft, queue times, dodging, and almost all other factors included. The amount of time necessary to complete this means it can take anywhere from 2 hours to 5 hours a day. Multiply this time by seven and you get nearly a full time job just to grind to level 100. This is an incredibly difficult task that is impossible to do without boosting or abusing the system using AFK Bots and Surrendering.

Any amount of fame that is needed to reach level 100 should be such a number that the top grind guilds believe it is possible, but still difficult to achieve as it is reserved only for the top guilds. The reason that the fame changes occurred in season two was because too many guilds went over level ninety and received the maximum rewards. However, the change has caused players to feel as if achieving this level is impossible, which is not something people usually feel when playing Vainglory. If a player believes something is difficult to achieve but still possible, then it is perfect. To feel as if achieving level 100 is impossible and having the guilds never try is counterproductive to the mindset of all the guilds.

In order to solve this, it is important to use the guild types.. A guild in the casual category will be set to fame values as they were in season one allowing players and guilds to play together to reach level 100. However, the prizes for casual guilds are adjusted dramatically lower to be meant for these guilds. The other option would be for competitive guilds.

This gives the ability to choose the casual guild system, or the competitive System. However, the current competitive system is still a seemingly impossible goal.. By removing the extra 930,000 fame it requires to hit level 100 from level eighty, the chance to hit max level without using any boosts or cheating is much more plausible for the top competitive guilds. With just these twenty levels removed from the required fame, it only needs 31,400 fame from players in a twelve week period. It is a much more realistic goal that players can achieve, but still difficult enough that only a few guilds can achieve it and is reserved for the best guilds.

## Invite/Kick Log

A log of players joining or leaving a guild or team is essential to its survival and growth. It is important to be able to know a few different details in regards to a join/leave event.

### Invite Log

* IGN of player joining

* IGN of player who invited

* Date Joined

### Leave Log

* IGN of player leaving

* IGN of player who kicked them, if player leaves on their own then null

* Date left/removed

* Reason for removal
